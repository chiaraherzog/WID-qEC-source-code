\subsection{Detailed study cohort description}

\subsubsection{FORECEE Study – discovery, Pilot, and Validation sets}

The FORECEE study (overview in Figure S1) was conducted as part of a multi-centre initiative involving 15 recruitment sites across Europe. Women diagnosed with endometrial cancer (cases) or a non-malignant benign gynaecological condition (controls) were approached during outpatient hospital clinics, while healthy volunteers from the general population (population-based controls) were approached via outreach campaigns, public engagement, and as part of cervical screening programs. Women with a current diagnosis of grade 3 and/or stage 1B or above endometrial cancer were eligible for the study as endometrial cancer cases. Grade 3 and above were specified \textit{a priori} to identify women at the highest risk for fatal endometrial cancer. Endometrial cancer cases furthermore had to be recruited prior to receiving any systemic treatment, surgery, or radiotherapy. Women who had a previous cancer (apart from non-melanoma skin cancer) were excluded. The study itself was a sub-study of the FORECEE (4C) Program, which has ethical approval from the UK Health Research Authority (REC 14/LO/1633) and all other contributing centres. After signing an informed consent, cervical samples were collected at appropriate clinical venues by trained staff. Cervical sample procedures were performed by a small group of research midwives or physicians using the ThinPrep system (Hologic Inc., cat #70098-002) according to the same standard operating procedures. Cervical cells were sampled from the cervix using a Cervex brush (Rovers Medical Devices, cat #70671-001) which was rotated 5 times through 360 degrees whilst in contact with the cervix to maximise cell sampling. For all endometrial cancers, histological confirmation was available.

Samples of the FORECEE Study were used for multiple purposes: 1) discovery of epigenome-wide regions of interest, 2) MethyLight reaction testing and threshold selection in a small pilot set (FORECEE Pilot, Figure S2), and 3) testing of the finalised WID\textsuperscript{TM}-qEC (FORECEE Validation, Figure S3). For epigenome-wide discovery of regions of interest, cervical samples from 144 endometrial cancer cases and 572 cancer-free controls (group-matched ~1:4 by age) were subjected to methylation array analysis. MethyLight Reactions assessing the top 50 regions were designed and subsequently tested in the FORECEE Pilot Set, consisting of 20 samples from individuals with endometrial cancer with high and low inferred tumour DNA and 1:1 individually matched controls by age, resulting in identification of the top 3 reactions (WID\textsuperscript{TM}-qEC) and selection of a threshold (Figure S10). The WID\textsuperscript{TM}-qEC was then validated in the FORECEE Validation set, consisting of samples from 66 controls and 71 endometrial cancer cases (group-matched ~1:1 by age).

\subsubsection{Barcelona Validation set.}

The patient flow is shown in Figure S4. Participants were recruited at Bellvitge University Hospital and ASSIR Delta between 2017-2021 and provided written informed consent (ethical approvals PR128/16 and PR348/19). For the WID\textsuperscript{TM}-qEC test, 155 consecutive incident endometrial cancer cases were enrolled, as well as 136 hospital controls, including 113 hospital controls with benign conditions and 23 women attending hospital for non-gynaecological diseases, frequency-matched to cases by age (n=291). Inclusion criteria included having an intact uterus and, for cases, having an incident diagnosis of endometrial cancer. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, puerperium (8 weeks), communication difficulties, intellectual disability, prior treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy during the previous 6 months, and other gynaecological malignancies or precursor lesion. Controls were group-matched to cases by age (tiers of 5 years). Women were asked to provide a self-collected sample using an Evalyn® Brush (Rovers® Medical Devices). Samples from 251 women (131 with endometrial cancer, 102 with benign conditions including endometriosis, fibroids, benign cysts, prolapse, polyps, and abnormal bleeding, and 18 hospital controls) had sufficient DNA for the WID\textsuperscript{TM}-qEC test. Group matching by age was maintained after removal of 40 samples with insufficient DNA. 121/251 samples were self-collected and 130/251 were obtained by healthcare professional assisted self-collection. For all endometrial cancer cases and controls with benign gynaecological conditions, histological data was available. In 95/251 (39\%) women, DNA was isolated for Duplex Sequencing to assess DNA mutations prior to the WIDTM-qEC. For 139 and 220 women, data on ultrasound thickness and categorization normal versus abnormal, respectively, were available. For 88 women data for all three modalities - DNA mutations, DNA methylation, and ultrasound (categorical) - were available (Figure S5), while for 64, DNA mutation data, DNA methylation, and numerical ultrasound data were available.

\subsubsection{PMB Cohort Set.}

The patient flow is shown in Figure S6. A total of 92 women presented with postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) at the University College London Hospital outpatient clinic between November 2015 and April 2016. Seventy-four (74/92, 80.4\%) agreed to participate and provided written informed consent (ethical approval by the Joint University College London/University College London Hospital Committees on the Ethics of Human Research No 06/Q0502/89). Reasons for not participating included women not wanting to spend the time reading patient information sheets or signing a consent form, or in a few cases, the lack of availability of consent forms in other languages. Prior to any examination, women provided a swab from the posterior vaginal fornix for the WID\textsuperscript{TM}-qEC test. Subsequently 8/74 (10.8\%) of the patients were diagnosed with endometrial cancer on biopsy whereas the remaining 66 patients were deemed to be cancer-free (41 had an entire normal ultrasound and were not recommended for biopsy and 25 had benign changes on endometrial biopsy). For 63/74 samples, sufficient DNA was available for WID\textsuperscript{TM}-qEC analysis (8 endometrial cancer cases, 55 cancer-free controls).

\subsubsection{Lynch Cohort Set.}

The patient flow is shown in Figure S7. After invitation and signing an informed consent, a total of 25 consecutive women presenting at the University College London Hospital outpatient clinic due to Lynch syndrome were recruited between December 2016 and January 2018. Ethical approval for the study was provided by the Joint University College London/University College London Hospital Committees on the Ethics of Human Research No. 06/Q0502/89. All but one of the volunteers, who refused an endometrial biopsy, had at least one histological assessment of the endometrium in the subsequent three years. In 23/24 women, initial endometrial biopsies did not show signs of cancer. 3/24 women were diagnosed with endometrial cancer subsequent to cervical sample collection, all of which were endometrioid endometrial cancers, grade 1, stage 1A. In one of these patients, the reference test, an endometrial biopsy preceding the prophylactic hysterectomy, was also negative. In another patient, the cervical sample was taken on the same day as the biopsy that led to cancer diagnosis. In the last patient, the reference test (in this case ultrasound) at the time of cervical sample collection was also negative, showing an endometrial thickness of only 3.5 mm on ultrasound. The cancer was diagnosed 8 months later.

\subsubsection{Karolinska Cohort Set.}

The patient flow is shown in Figure S8. All cervical liquid-based cytology samples processed in the capital region of Stockholm in Sweden are biobanked through a state-of-the-art platform at the Karolinska University Laboratory, Karolinska University Hospital, as previously described \textsuperscript{1}. Since 2013, virtually 100\% of the ~150,000 LBCs per year are compacted and stored in a 600 microliter, 96 well plate format at -27°C. This allows for preservation of whole cells, and analyses of DNA, RNA, and protein content, among others. The biobank is linked to the Swedish health register infrastructure through the individually unique personal identification number (PIN) \textsuperscript{2}. A cohort was defined of all women participating in cervical screening, or clinically indicated testing, during the years 2011-2015 and linked to the National Cancer Register at the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare, to identify all cases of endometrial cancer occurring in the sample collection during these years. Population-based control women were frequency matched in a 1:2 ratio to the cases, by age, sample type (screening-based or clinic-based), and calendar year of sample (Table 1). Selected samples were checked for visible pellets and those with visible pellets and sufficient DNA after extraction were subjected to the WID\textsuperscript{TM}-qEC test.


\subsection{WID\textsuperscript{TM}-qEC methylation assay development.}

To identify regions of interest for a PCR-based assay, we assessed DNA methylation at ~850,000 CpG sites in cervical smear samples from women from the FORECEE project with (n=144) and without (n=572) endometrial cancer using the Infinium MethylationEPIC array. Power calculations followed guidelines relating to EWAS study sizes as reported 35 and aimed to include at least 100 cases to detect a methylation odds ratio of 1.51 at a power of 80% and genome-wide significance of 10-6. Aiming to reduce sampling bias and improve power of our case control study, we included 4 controls for each cancer case (group-matching by age). We visually inspected the top 50 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and CpGs 500 bp up- or downstream and designed MethyLight reactions for regions whose index CpG and surrounding CpGs showed the biggest difference between cases and controls, and where at least one CpG showed no or very low methylation in controls. We selected 37 suitable regions (examplary regions shown in Figure 1B, C). We assessed DNA methylation at these 37 regions in 20 cases and 20 controls in the FORECEE Pilot Set (Figure 1D) and ranked the reactions according to their ROC AUC (Figure 1D). The performance of the DNA methylation markers was independent from the immune cell proportion in the cervical sample (Figure 1B). The top three reactions were selected for the WID\textsuperscript{TM}-qEC, and the threshold was set using optimal cut-points of the ROC curve (Youden index). Using publicly available data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, we confirmed that the top three regions (2 independent regions of \textit{GYPC} and \textit{ZSCAN12}) were significantly hypermethylated in solid endometrial cancer tissue when compared to normal endometrium (Figure S9). We added the PMR values of all three top reactions and defined two WIDTM-qEC $Σ$ PMR thresholds via the optimal Youden cutpoints in the FORECEE Pilot set ROC (Figure S10) - 0.03 (Threshold 1) and 0.63 (Threshold 2) - which obtained a sensitivity/specificity of 95/90\% and 85/100\%, respectively (Table 2).

\subsection{WID\textsuperscript{TM}-qEC MethyLight assay.}

MethyLight analysis was performed as previously described \textsuperscript{3}, with some modifications. Cervical DNA was extracted and normalized to 25 ng/uL using the Nucleo-Mag Blood 200 uL kit (Macherey Nagel, cat #744501.4). DNA concentration was measured using the Qubit\textsuperscript{TM} 4 Fluorometer (InvitrogenTM). 500 ng of extracted DNA were bisulfite modified and eluted to a concentration of 4 ng/µl using the EZ-96 DNA Methylation-Lightning\textsuperscript{TM} Kit (Zymo Research, cat. #D5033) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. 20 ng of bisulfite modified DNA were amplified in a 20 uL reaction containing 1x Luna® Universal Probe qPCR Master Mix (NEB®, cat. #M3004G) and primer-probe sets listed in Table S2. All PCR reactions – i.e. the three markers regions in the \textit{ZSCAN12} and \textit{GYPC} (two independent regions) genes as well as the reference gene \textit{COL2A1} – were run in duplicates. To normalize for DNA input and efficacy of bisulfite modification in each reaction, \textit{COL2A1} was selected as the reference gene. Human, double-stranded gBlocks\textsuperscript{TM} Gene Fragments (IDT\textsuperscript{TM}) containing known copy numbers of each analyzed target and \textit{COL2A1} functioned as equivalent fully methylated calibrator and as qPCR standard curve material. PCR reactions were run on the QuantStudio\textsuperscript{TM} 7 Pro (Applied Biosystems\textsuperscript{TM}) and results further extracted via the Design & Analysis Software 2.5.0 (Applied Biosystems\textsuperscript{TM}). The percentage of fully methylated reference (PMR) molecules at the target locus was standardized using an R script, dividing the target to \textit{COL2A1} input amount ratio (derived using the \textit{COL2A1} standard curve; equation 1) of a sample by the target to \textit{COL2A1} input amount ratio of gBlocks\textsuperscript{TM} Gene Fragments DNA and multiplying by 100 (equation 2). For a subset of samples, the assay was conducted single- rather than multi-plex, using bisulfite-converted fully methylated \textit{Sss1}-treated DNA instead of gBlocks as the reference. Single- and multiplex reactions were cross-validated in the same samples (correlation of WID\textsuperscript{TM}-qEC values=0.974, p \textless 2.2\textsuperscript{-16}).

Equation 1.

\begin{equation}
input~amount = 10^{\frac{Ct~target-intercept[COL2A1~standard~curve]}{slope[COL2A1~standard~curve]}}
\end{equation}

Equation 2.

\begin{equation}
PMR = \frac{\frac{t\textsubscript{s}}{c\textsubscript{s}}}{\frac{t\textsubscript{g}}{c\textsubscript{g}}} * 100
\end{equation}


where \textit{t} refers to the input amount of the target, \textit{c} refers to the input amount of \textit{COL2A1}, \textsubscript{s} refers to the sample, and \textsubscript{g} refers to the gBlock.


\subsection{DNA mutation analysis.}

The exonic regions of \textit{PTEN}, \textit{TP53}, \textit{PIK3CA}, \textit{ARID1A} and \textit{CTNNB1} were included in a larger panel spanning 247 kb. The reference genome used to design the SeqCap EZ probe pool (NimbleGen, Roche) was GRCh38 (hg38). Prefparation of genomic DNA libraries was performed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations with certain variations to add unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). In brief, A-tailed fragments were ligated to the xGen CS Adapters (Integrated DNA Technologies). Duplex Seq adapters contain an equimolar pool of 64 pairs of duplexed adapters, each containing a 3 bp UMI. For each library, 0.75 pmol of adapters were added and ligated for 15 minutes at 20ºC. Next, libraries were PCR amplified using a final concentration of 4 uM of UDI Dup Seq amplification primers (Integrated DNA Technologies). Samples were sequenced in a NovaSeq SP platform (Illumina) at very high depth (20,000x). The deduplication process was performed using a combination of Picard, fgbio and bwa tools. Reads with the same tag were combined to generate consensus reads independently of the source strand. VarDictJava and Mutect2, in tumour-only mode, were used for variant calling. Variants detected by both callers and with variant allele frequency (VAF)>0.5\% were considered and filtered by quality and predicted effect at protein level. A list of changes found recurrently in control samples (minimum 5 samples) were used to filter out false positive calls, this highlights false positive variants that are recurrently called in the same position across a high number of samples are due to misalignments of the reads and can be considered artefacts of the technique. At least one gene had to exhibit a mutation to be DNA mutation-positive.

\textbf{Figure S14. WID\textsuperscript{TM}-qEC assessment in a high-risk Lynch Cohort.} The WID\textsuperscript{TM}-qEC test does not yield false-positives in a high risk Cohort of women with Lynch syndrome. In 2/3 cancers which were not detected using the WID\textsuperscript{TM}-qEC test, the reference test was also negative and the cancers were identified 8 months later or following prophylactic hysteroscopy. One cancer that was detected by endometrial biopsy following cervical sample donation was correctly identified using threshold 1.
